# Expanding DeFi on Flow EVM with Cadence Orchestration

This document outlines various opportunities to grow the DeFi ecosystem on Flow by leveraging its new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support, alongside the unique features of the Cadence programming language. The overarching goal is to increase total value locked (TVL) on Flow by bringing over established DeFi building blocks, innovating with new primitives, and enabling complex strategies through atomic orchestration.

## 1. Porting Established DeFi Primitives

### 1.1 Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

- **Uniswap v2, v3, v4**  
  - **v2**: Classic constant-product market maker.  
  - **v3**: Concentrated liquidity, enabling LPs to choose a price range for more capital efficiency.  
  - **v4**: Potential for custom “hooks” to extend liquidity and fee mechanisms.  

- **Curve Stable Pools**  
  - Hybrid function that behaves like constant sum near equilibrium, reducing slippage for stablecoins.

**Rationale**  
Bringing these well-known AMMs to Flow EVM provides immediate liquidity solutions and yield-farming opportunities. Users migrating from Ethereum will find a familiar interface, while newcomers to DeFi can access proven tools.

---

### 1.2 Lending Protocols

- Protocols like **Aave**, **Compound**, or **Morpho** for borrowing/lending markets.  
- Highly important for tapping into leverage, earning interest, and supporting money markets.

**Rationale**  
These protocols anchor most DeFi ecosystems by facilitating on-chain credit. Porting them can drive substantial TVL growth and cross-protocol synergy (e.g., borrowed assets for yield farming).

---

### 1.3 Yield Tokenization (Pendle Finance & Beyond)

- **Pendle Finance** splits yield-bearing tokens into principal (PT) and yield (YT) components.  
- Enables separate trading of principal and yield, opening new opportunities for interest-rate speculation or yield optimization.

**Rationale**  
Advanced yield tokenization draws in sophisticated investors who want fine-grained control over their exposure to interest rates. Offering these functionalities on Flow EVM can attract more complex strategies and capital inflows.

---

### 1.4 Leveraged Yield Farming

- Borrow assets from a lending protocol to **amplify** positions in an AMM (like Uniswap v3).  
- Users deposit collateral, borrow stablecoins or other tokens, and then provide concentrated liquidity at a chosen range.  
- Can **compound yields** but also needs robust liquidation/maintenance margin logic to manage risk.

**Rationale**  
Leveraged yield farming is a proven TVL driver on other chains. With Cadence’s atomic transactions, users could open, close, and adjust leveraged LP positions in one seamless flow, mitigating partial-step risk.

## 2. Advanced Orchestration with Cadence

Flow’s resource-oriented Cadence language can coordinate EVM actions atomically, ensuring multi-step DeFi strategies execute fully or revert to a safe state.

### 2.1 Atomic & Composable Transactions

1. **Borrow** using collateral locked in a lending protocol.  
2. **Provide Liquidity** on an AMM (e.g., Uniswap v3) with a specific price range.  
3. If the price exits that range, automatically **close** the LP position, **repay** the loan, and **liquidate** any remaining assets—all in a single atomic transaction.

**Benefits**  
- Fewer on-chain steps for the user, reducing transaction fees and complexity.  
- Lower operational risk, since either everything completes or nothing does.

### 2.2 Lower Block Times & Continuous Margin Checks

- Flow’s lower block times make it more feasible to replicate **Deribit-style** margin maintenance, where a user can open a perpetual position and simultaneously buy/sell options, with real-time checks on collateral.  
- Cadence can coordinate immediate liquidations or adjustments if margin requirements are not met.

**Benefits**  
- More sophisticated margining systems become possible, appealing to advanced derivatives traders.  
- Reduces “waiting risk” inherent in slower block-time environments.

### 2.3 Staked & Exotic Collateral

- Users could collateralize positions with **staked tokens** (e.g., staked ETH) or **AMM LP tokens** themselves.  
- This is rarely available on centralized exchanges, offering a unique DeFi advantage.  
- Potential for layered strategies: e.g., using an LP token that itself earns yield, while simultaneously opening a power perpetual or a perpetual option.

**Benefits**  
- More capital efficiency: staked or yield-bearing collateral continues earning rewards.  
- Uniquely attractive to traders who want to “stack” yield on top of leveraged positions.

## 3. Introducing New Derivatives

### 3.1 Perpetual Options

- **No Expiry**: Similar to perpetual futures but structured as call/put options.  
- **Funding Fees** maintain equilibrium between buyers and sellers.  
- Can have dynamic or rolling strike prices.

**Rationale**  
Provides indefinite optionality for traders who prefer “option-like” payoffs without rolling over monthly expiries. This captures **Gamma** exposure that linear perpetuals miss, attracting options-based hedgers and speculators.

### 3.2 Power Perpetuals

- **Asset^2 or Asset^3** exposures for non-linear gains or losses.  
- Positions avoid immediate liquidation purely on price drops, relying on **funding payments** to sustain.  
- Creates amplified upside (and complex downside) with less typical margin calls.

**Rationale**  
Offers exotic leveraged exposure that differs from standard x2 or x3 leveraged tokens. Traders can benefit from squared or cubed payoff profiles, attracting those who want high volatility or advanced hedging strategies.

## 4. Centralized Exchange Features for DeFi

### 4.1 Multi-Leg Strategies & Unified Margin

- **Options + Perpetuals** in one account, similar to how Deribit allows ETH collateral with an option position plus perpetual futures.  
- **Cross-margin** to manage multiple correlated positions, optimizing margin usage and reducing liquidation risk.

### 4.2 Conditional Orders & Advanced Order Types

- **Stop-loss, trailing stops, limit orders** orchestrated on-chain or semi-on-chain.  
- Cadence can handle triggers or incorporate an oracle-based approach to automatically execute trades when certain price conditions are met.

### 4.3 Combining AMMs & Options

- Centralized exchanges typically rely on order books. AMMs let users deposit liquidity and earn fees passively.  
- Lower barrier for users to earn yield without running complex market-maker infrastructure.

**Rationale**  
Replicates many advanced trading tools from centralized exchanges, but in a trustless, on-chain setting. Flow’s throughput and Cadence-driven orchestration make real-time margin maintenance and advanced order strategies more viable.

## 5. Combining Yield Tokenization with Expiry-Based Derivatives

- **PT (Principal Token) + YT (Yield Token)** often carry an expiry (e.g., yield accrues until maturity).  
- **Options and Futures** also use expiry.  
- Potential for structured products that align yield token expiration with option expiration, creating interesting payoffs (e.g., lock in a fixed yield while writing covered calls that mature simultaneously).

### Possible Innovations

- **Fixed-End DeFi Products**: Where both the principal and the option expire on the same date, simplifying payoff scenarios.  
- **Hedging Interest Rate Volatility**: Trade the YT portion while holding an option that matures concurrently, reducing the overall rate-exposure risk.  
- **Yield Curve Strategies**: Build swap-like products that capture or hedge yield changes over specific intervals, akin to interest rate swaps in TradFi.

## 6. Why These Protocols & Strategies Are Needed

1. **Broader Range of Financial Products**  
   - Capturing **gamma** (via options) and **non-linear payoffs** (via power perpetuals) appeals to more sophisticated traders.  
   - Filling the gap between simple perpetuals and advanced derivatives found in traditional finance.

2. **Composability & User Control**  
   - DeFi users can combine staked assets, yield tokens, leveraged LP positions, and derivatives all on-chain.  
   - Retains user custody of assets without trusting a centralized exchange.

3. **Potential for Higher TVL**  
   - Each new DeFi primitive (AMM, lending, yield tokenization, options, advanced derivatives) typically boosts locked liquidity.  
   - More sophisticated products encourage capital inflows from traders seeking yield or hedging.

4. **Ease of Earning Yield**  
   - Automated market makers provide yield opportunities to everyday users who can’t run professional market-making bots.  
   - Staking or LP tokens as collateral let users “double dip” on rewards (e.g., earn yield while also holding a leveraged or option position).

## 7. Path Forward

1. **Immediate**  
   - **Fork** existing DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Curve, Lending) onto Flow EVM for fast liquidity bootstrapping.  
   - Provide guides/tools so users can replicate strategies they know from Ethereum.

2. **Intermediate**  
   - **Leverage Cadence** for atomic multi-step transactions (e.g., leveraged yield farming, auto-liquidation triggers).  
   - Integrate oracles (Chainlink or native Flow oracles) for on-chain price feeds.

3. **Long-Term**  
   - Develop **power perpetuals**, **perpetual options**, **multi-leg margin systems**, and **cross-collateral** solutions that are unique to Flow.  
   - Introduce advanced structured products, combining yield tokens and expiry-based derivatives to create novel payoff profiles.
