# Expanding DeFi on Flow EVM with Cadence Orchestration

This document outlines various opportunities to grow the DeFi ecosystem on Flow by leveraging its new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support, alongside the unique features of the Cadence programming language. The overarching goal is to increase total value locked (TVL) on Flow by bringing over established DeFi building blocks, innovating with new primitives, and enabling complex strategies through atomic orchestration.

---

## 1. Porting Established DeFi Primitives

### 1.1 Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

- **Uniswap v2, v3, v4**  
  - **v2**: Classic constant-product market maker.  
  - **v3**: Concentrated liquidity, enabling LPs to choose a price range for more capital efficiency.  
  - **v4**: Potential for custom “hooks” to extend liquidity and fee mechanisms.  

- **Curve Stable Pools**  
  - Hybrid function that behaves like constant sum near equilibrium, reducing slippage for stablecoins.

**Rationale**  
Bringing these well-known AMMs to Flow EVM provides immediate liquidity solutions and yield-farming opportunities. Users migrating from Ethereum will find a familiar interface, while newcomers to DeFi can access proven tools.

---

### 1.2 Lending Protocols

- Protocols like **Aave**, **Compound**, or **Morpho** for borrowing/lending markets.  
- Highly important for tapping into leverage, earning interest, and supporting money markets.

**Rationale**  
These protocols anchor most DeFi ecosystems by facilitating on-chain credit. Porting them can drive substantial TVL growth and cross-protocol synergy (e.g., borrowed assets for yield farming).

---

### 1.3 Yield Tokenization (Pendle Finance & Beyond)

- **Pendle Finance** splits yield-bearing tokens into principal (PT) and yield (YT) components.  
- Enables separate trading of principal and yield, opening new opportunities for interest-rate speculation or yield optimization.

**Rationale**  
Advanced yield tokenization draws in sophisticated investors who want fine-grained control over their exposure to interest rates. Offering these functionalities on Flow EVM can attract more complex strategies and capital inflows.

---

### 1.4 Leveraged Yield Farming

- Borrow assets from a lending protocol to **amplify** positions in an AMM (like Uniswap v3).  
- Users deposit collateral, borrow stablecoins or other tokens, and then provide concentrated liquidity at a chosen range.  
- Can **compound yields** but also needs robust liquidation/maintenance margin logic to manage risk.

**Rationale**  
Leveraged yield farming is a proven TVL driver on other chains. With Cadence’s atomic transactions, users could open, close, and adjust leveraged LP positions in one seamless flow, mitigating partial-step risk.

---

## 2. Advanced Orchestration with Cadence

Flow’s resource-oriented Cadence language can coordinate EVM actions atomically, ensuring multi-step DeFi strategies execute fully or revert to a safe state.

### 2.1 Atomic & Composable Transactions

1. **Borrow** using collateral locked in a lending protocol.  
2. **Provide Liquidity** on an AMM (e.g., Uniswap v3) with a specific price range.  
3. If the price exits that range, automatically **close** the LP position, **repay** the loan, and **liquidate** any remaining assets—all in a single atomic transaction.

**Benefits**  
- Fewer on-chain steps for the user, reducing transaction fees and complexity.  
- Lower operational risk, since either everything completes or nothing does.

### 2.2 Lower Block Times & Continuous Margin Checks

- Flow’s lower block times make it more feasible to replicate **Deribit-style** margin maintenance, where a user can open a perpetual position and simultaneously buy/sell options, with real-time checks on collateral.  
- Cadence can coordinate immediate liquidations or adjustments if margin requirements are not met.

**Benefits**  
- More sophisticated margining systems become possible, appealing to advanced derivatives traders.  
- Reduces “waiting risk” inherent in slower block-time environments.

### 2.3 Staked & Exotic Collateral

- Users could collateralize positions with **staked tokens** (e.g., staked ETH) or **AMM LP tokens** themselves.  
- This is rarely available on centralized exchanges, offering a unique DeFi advantage.  
- Potential for layered strategies: e.g., using an LP token that itself earns yield, while simultaneously opening a power perpetual or a perpetual option.

**Benefits**  
- More capital efficiency: staked or yield-bearing collateral continues earning rewards.  
- Uniquely attractive to traders who want to “stack” yield on top of leveraged positions.

---

## 3. Introducing New Derivatives

### 3.1 Perpetual Options

- **No Expiry**: Similar to perpetual futures but structured as call/put options.  
- **Funding Fees** maintain equilibrium between buyers and sellers.  
- Can have dynamic or rolling strike prices.

**Rationale**  
Provides indefinite optionality for traders who prefer “option-like” payoffs without rolling over monthly expiries. This captures **Gamma** exposure that linear perpetuals miss, attracting options-based hedgers and speculators.

### 3.2 Power Perpetuals

- **Asset^2 or Asset^3** exposures for non-linear gains or losses.  
- Positions avoid immediate liquidation purely on price drops, relying on **funding payments** to sustain.  
- Creates amplified upside (and complex downside) with less typical margin calls.

**Rationale**  
Offers exotic leveraged exposure that differs from standard x2 or x3 leveraged tokens. Traders can benefit from squared or cubed payoff profiles, attracting those who want high volatility or advanced hedging strategies.

---

## 4. Centralized Exchange Features for DeFi

### 4.1 Multi-Leg Strategies & Unified Margin

- **Options + Perpetuals** in one account, similar to how Deribit allows ETH collateral with an option position plus perpetual futures.  
- **Cross-margin** to manage multiple correlated positions, optimizing margin usage and reducing liquidation risk.

### 4.2 Conditional Orders & Advanced Order Types

- **Stop-loss, trailing stops, limit orders** orchestrated on-chain or semi-on-chain.  
- Cadence can handle triggers or incorporate an oracle-based approach to automatically execute trades when certain price conditions are met.

### 4.3 Combining AMMs & Options

- Centralized exchanges typically rely on order books. AMMs let users deposit liquidity and earn fees passively.  
- Lower barrier for users to earn yield without running complex market-maker infrastructure.

**Rationale**  
Replicates many advanced trading tools from centralized exchanges, but in a trustless, on-chain setting. Flow’s throughput and Cadence-driven orchestration make real-time margin maintenance and advanced order strategies more viable.

---

## 5. Combining Yield Tokenization with Expiry-Based Derivatives

- **PT (Principal Token) + YT (Yield Token)** often carry an expiry (e.g., yield accrues until maturity).  
- **Options and Futures** also use expiry.  
- Potential for structured products that align yield token expiration with option expiration, creating interesting payoffs (e.g., lock in a fixed yield while writing covered calls that mature simultaneously).

### Possible Innovations

- **Fixed-End DeFi Products**: Where both the principal and the option expire on the same date, simplifying payoff scenarios.  
- **Hedging Interest Rate Volatility**: Trade the YT portion while holding an option that matures concurrently, reducing the overall rate-exposure risk.  
- **Yield Curve Strategies**: Build swap-like products that capture or hedge yield changes over specific intervals, akin to interest rate swaps in TradFi.

---

## 6. Why These Protocols & Strategies Are Needed

1. **Broader Range of Financial Products**  
   - Capturing **gamma** (via options) and **non-linear payoffs** (via power perpetuals) appeals to more sophisticated traders.  
   - Filling the gap between simple perpetuals and advanced derivatives found in traditional finance.

2. **Composability & User Control**  
   - DeFi users can combine staked assets, yield tokens, leveraged LP positions, and derivatives all on-chain.  
   - Retains user custody of assets without trusting a centralized exchange.

3. **Potential for Higher TVL**  
   - Each new DeFi primitive (AMM, lending, yield tokenization, options, advanced derivatives) typically boosts locked liquidity.  
   - More sophisticated products encourage capital inflows from traders seeking yield or hedging.

4. **Ease of Earning Yield**  
   - Automated market makers provide yield opportunities to everyday users who can’t run professional market-making bots.  
   - Staking or LP tokens as collateral let users “double dip” on rewards (e.g., earn yield while also holding a leveraged or option position).

---

## 7. Path Forward

1. **Immediate**  
   - **Fork** existing DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Curve, Lending) onto Flow EVM for fast liquidity bootstrapping.  
   - Provide guides/tools so users can replicate strategies they know from Ethereum.

2. **Intermediate**  
   - **Leverage Cadence** for atomic multi-step transactions (e.g., leveraged yield farming, auto-liquidation triggers).  
   - Integrate oracles (Chainlink or native Flow oracles) for on-chain price feeds.

3. **Long-Term**  
   - Develop **power perpetuals**, **perpetual options**, **multi-leg margin systems**, and **cross-collateral** solutions that are unique to Flow.  
   - Introduce advanced structured products, combining yield tokens and expiry-based derivatives to create novel payoff profiles.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Flow’s EVM integration opens the door for established DeFi protocols to migrate seamlessly, attracting immediate TVL. More importantly, Cadence’s resource-oriented paradigm and rapid block times enable advanced features that surpass what is typically available on Ethereum mainnet:

- **Atomic multi-step strategies** that reduce user friction and partial-execution risk.  
- **Sophisticated derivatives** (power perpetuals, perpetual options, cross-margin solutions).  
- **Collateral innovation** using staked tokens, yield tokens, and AMM LP tokens.  
- **New structured products** aligning different expiry-based assets.

By combining proven DeFi building blocks with Flow’s unique technology, the ecosystem can deliver an integrated platform for both casual yield farmers and sophisticated derivatives traders—driving higher TVL and setting Flow apart in an increasingly competitive DeFi landscape.

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **Dashboard Overview**  
   - Shows a consolidated view of total account value (`$13.73` in this example).  
   - Sections for Positions, Open Orders, Trades, and Expiry Greeks are all present but currently empty.  

2. **Asset Balances**  
   - Displays user holdings for BTC and ETH, each with a corresponding USD value.  
   - Quick “Trade” or “Wallet” actions are available alongside each asset.  

3. **Navigation & Tools**  
   - Top navigation includes tabs like **Spot**, **Futures**, **Options**, **Strategy**, along with sub-features such as Price Ladder and Option Wizard.  
   - The “What’s Hot Today” panel highlights top-performing or highest-volume options/futures.

4. **Option-Focused Exchange**  
   - Deribit is well-known for BTC and ETH options/futures. The interface reflects an options-centric layout, surfacing option strikes, volumes, and mark prices.

---

### What It Has

- A clean dashboard that consolidates multiple product types (Futures, Options) in one place.  
- Integrated “Trade” button for quick order placement from the asset list.  
- Real-time or near real-time price data and volume statistics for active options.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **On-Chain Collateral Options**  
   - No direct way to use staked tokens or AMM LP tokens as collateral.  
   - Traditional centralized approach: only BTC or ETH in custodial wallets.

2. **Composability**  
   - Lacks the ability to automate multi-step operations (e.g., borrow -> hedge -> yield farm) in a single transaction.  
   - No resource-oriented system like Cadence that enforces how assets move atomically within the same environment.

3. **Unified Margin Across Multiple Instruments**  
   - While Deribit does some margining across options/futures, it’s not as flexible as a DeFi platform might be (e.g., using multiple DeFi protocols to cross-collateralize).

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **Integrated Dashboard on Flow**  
   - A Flow-based dashboard could similarly present a consolidated view of all positions (lending, AMMs, derivatives) in one place.  
   - Users could see staked tokens, LP tokens, and borrowed assets alongside their net account value.

2. **Expand Collateral Types**  
   - Enable staked ETH, yield-bearing tokens (e.g., from AMMs), or even NFT-based collateral.  
   - Provide real-time margin checks with lower block times on Flow.

3. **Atomic Strategies**  
   - Use Cadence to combine multiple steps (e.g., open a position in an options protocol, simultaneously supply collateral to a Flow EVM lending market) under one transaction.  
   - Could replicate or enhance Deribit’s user experience with more DeFi-like flexibility.

4. **Dynamic “What’s Hot” Panel for DeFi**  
   - Display top-yielding LP pools, highest APY lending pools, or trending option strikes from a Flow-based derivatives protocol.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**: A Flow-based options or futures platform could match Deribit’s intuitive interface but also incorporate staked collateral, cross-protocol margining, and automated liquidation triggers via Cadence.  
- **Potential Next Steps**: Build a “Flow Deribit” prototype that supports non-linear payoffs (e.g., power perpetuals) or perpetual options, all orchestrated in a single environment.

# Platform: Deribit

## Screenshot 2
**Image**  
![Screenshot 2 – Deribit Margin & Options](DeFi-Platforms-Comparison/Deribit-Account-Summary.png)

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **Account Summary & Segregated Values**  
   - Shows a table of each asset (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, MATIC, etc.), alongside columns for equity, PNL, fee balance, and **“Greek” metrics** (Gamma, Vega, Theta).  
   - The rightmost columns track Margin Balance, Available Balance, Initial Margin (IM) projected, and Maintenance Margin (MM) projected.  

2. **Advanced Margining**  
   - Deribit segregates collateral per asset and displays cumulative margin usage.  
   - Highlights a sophisticated margin model that calculates real-time requirements based on open positions and Greeks.  

3. **Available Options**  
   - At the bottom, a tabbed interface for different expiry dates (09 MAR 25, 11 MAR 25, etc.) and a real-time order book for calls/puts.  
   - Underlying is listed at **\$91,320.84** with **Time to Expiry** for each contract.  

4. **Cross vs. Isolated Values**  
   - The platform shows “Segregated values” (per asset) and “Cross values.” This indicates how different positions might share margin across instruments.  
   - The “Margin Balance” and “Available Balance” columns reflect how much of each asset’s equity is allocated to open trades.

---

### What It Has

- **Detailed Margin & Greek Breakdown**  
  - Gamma, Vega, Theta, Delta projections give a near-professional approach to risk management.  

- **Multiple Expiry Selections**  
  - A variety of expiries for BTC options, with real-time bid/ask and implied volatility.  

- **Projected Maintenance Margin**  
  - A direct readout of potential margin calls if positions shift.  

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **Staked Token Collateral**  
   - All collateral is base assets (BTC, ETH, USDC, etc.). There’s no use of yield-bearing or staked tokens.  

2. **Composable Cross-Protocol Margin**  
   - This system only accounts for Deribit’s internal positions. DeFi can unify margin across lending, AMMs, options, etc. in one environment.  

3. **On-Chain Visibility**  
   - Values, positions, and margin calculations are hidden behind centralized logic. In DeFi, real-time on-chain data can be more transparent.  

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **On-Chain Greek Calculations**  
   - A Flow-based protocol could similarly compute Greeks on-chain (or via oracles) for user positions, giving advanced risk metrics.  

2. **Cross-Asset & Cross-Protocol Margin**  
   - In a Flow DeFi system, margin usage could factor in multiple protocols: e.g., a user’s borrowed USDC, staked ETH, and an AMM LP position.  
   - Cadence could orchestrate real-time margin checks across these protocols to handle partial unwinds or top-ups automatically.  

3. **Composite Collateral**  
   - Users could pledge staked tokens or LP tokens as collateral while earning yield.  
   - Margin is dynamically adjusted by a central manager contract or aggregator that monitors the user’s net liquidity across the ecosystem.  

4. **Greek-Driven Liquidation Logic**  
   - In a resource-based system, if a user’s “Delta Total (Projected)” crosses a threshold, the system could automatically execute a partial liquidation to reduce risk.  
   - Could be done atomically through Cadence transactions without manual intervention.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**  
  - A Flow DeFi platform can match Deribit’s robust margin model but extend it to unique collateral types and multi-protocol exposure.  
  - Transparent on-chain data for Greeks, margin usage, and liquidation thresholds could build trust and reduce opaqueness.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Implement a multi-protocol margin aggregator on Flow EVM, using Cadence to track user positions across lending pools, AMMs, and derivative contracts.  
  - Offer advanced data analytics, including Greeks, while letting users supply staked collateral and remain eligible for auto-liquidation triggers.

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **BTC-PERPETUAL Chart & Order Book**  
   - A real-time price chart for BTC perpetual swaps, including typical candlestick visuals, trading volume, and technical indicators.  
   - The order book shows live bids/asks, trade sizes, and recent trades on the right panel.

2. **Futures/Perpetual Swap Features**  
   - Users can select **Order Form** options: Limit, Market, Post-only, Reduce-only, etc.  
   - Includes fields for leverage (“Max Leverage x50”) and advanced parameters like Take Profit and Stop Loss in the same interface.

3. **Funding & Premium**  
   - Displays a “Funding/8h” rate, typical for perpetual futures to maintain the contract price close to the index.  
   - “Premium” metric indicates how much higher or lower the perpetual is trading relative to the spot price.

---

### What It Has

- **Live Candlestick Chart** with standard TA overlays.  
- **Deep Liquidity & Frequent Trades** in the order book.  
- **Flexible Order Settings** such as stop loss, take profit, and post-only orders.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **Collateral Diversity**  
   - Still restricted to BTC/ETH or stablecoins for margin.  
   - DeFi could allow staked tokens, yield-bearing assets, or LP tokens as collateral.

2. **Composability**  
   - In a decentralized environment, traders might seamlessly borrow stablecoins from one protocol, hedge with a perpetual on another, and stake surplus liquidity elsewhere—all from one interface or atomic transaction.

3. **Permissionless/On-Chain Transparency**  
   - Order book and matching engine are internal to Deribit, limiting the trustless aspect.  
   - A DeFi environment might use an AMM-based perpetual model or an on-chain order book for full transparency.

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **AMM-Based Perpetuals on Flow**  
   - Instead of an off-chain order book, a smart-contract AMM (similar to dYdX or GMX) could track perpetual swaps.  
   - Cadence could enforce margin checks and handle funding payments automatically.

2. **Direct Integration of Hedging/Leverage Steps**  
   - A user might borrow stablecoins and instantly open a leveraged short or long in a single transaction.  
   - Could replicate a similar UI but with direct references to on-chain vaults and positions.

3. **Customizable Funding Rates**  
   - Flow-based perpetuals could adopt flexible or dynamic funding rates that users can see/update on-chain, ensuring more transparent or community-governed parameters.

4. **Combine with Option Positions**  
   - Some DeFi protocols let users run a “perp + option” strategy in one place.  
   - Could set up a transaction where the user simultaneously opens a perp position and sells a covered call, with margin managed in a single Cadence-based flow.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to a DeFi Perp DEX**  
  - Deribit’s UI is streamlined for professional traders, but DeFi can unify multiple protocols (lending, yield, options) behind the scenes.  
  - On-chain, all actions are transparent and verifiable, which can build trust among users who are wary of centralized matching engines.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Implement an AMM-based or hybrid order book for perpetuals on Flow EVM, with real-time funding calculations managed by Cadence.  
  - Expand collateral to staked/LP tokens, giving users the unique advantage of yield while holding a leveraged position.

---

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **BTC Options Chain View**  
   - Displays a traditional options chain for the **26 Dec 2025** expiry.  
   - Strikes are listed in the central column, with Calls on the left (Delta, IV, Bid/Ask) and Puts on the right (IV, Bid/Ask).  
   - Real-time mark prices, implied volatilities, and open interest/position data are visible.

2. **Comprehensive Option Details**  
   - Columns include `Δ|Delta`, `Size`, `IV Bid`, `Bid`, `Mark`, `Ask`, `IV Ask`, etc.  
   - The underlying future price is shown at **\$91,301.12**, with time to expiry listed as **292d 15h 46m**.

3. **Tabbed Expiries**  
   - Multiple expiry dates (09 MAR 25, 11 MAR 25, etc.) are selectable at the top, making it easy to switch between chains.

4. **Greek & Volatility Snapshot**  
   - The chain highlights implied volatility for both calls and puts, providing a snapshot of expected price movement.  
   - Traders can quickly compare how volatility changes across strikes and maturities.

---

### What It Has

- **Robust, Professional-Style Options Chain**  
  - Similar to a traditional brokerage or institutional options platform.  
- **Live Data** for each strike/expiry: implied volatility, bid/ask, mark, position size, etc.  
- **Ease of Comparison**: Calls and puts shown side by side around the current underlying price.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **On-Chain Options Settlement**  
   - Deribit centrally clears these options, whereas a DeFi solution would handle margining and final settlement on-chain.  
   - No direct use of staked or yield-bearing tokens as collateral for options.  

2. **Automated Option Strategies**  
   - Traders must manually structure spreads (e.g., straddles, strangles, covered calls), whereas DeFi can offer vaults or smart contracts that automate multi-leg strategies with atomic execution.  

3. **Atomic Position Combining**  
   - In DeFi, it’s possible to combine an options position with a lending or AMM liquidity position, all in one transaction, thanks to composability.

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **Flow EVM Option Protocol**  
   - Present a similarly detailed chain with real-time implied vol, calls, puts, and various expiries.  
   - Settlement and margin would be managed on-chain, with transparent, trustless execution.

2. **Composability with Yield Tokens**  
   - Traders might deposit yield-bearing assets (e.g., staked ETH) as collateral, simultaneously earning staking rewards while writing options.  
   - Could revolve around a Cadence-based system that automatically exercises or rolls options if certain conditions are met.

3. **Multi-Leg / Strategy Vaults**  
   - Offer “one-click” strategies (covered calls, bull call spreads, iron condors) that orchestrate multiple option legs plus collateral deposit in a single transaction.  
   - Cadence ensures resource safety, so partial execution doesn’t leave leftover tokens or incomplete legs.

4. **Integration with Perpetuals**  
   - A user could open a perpetual short on BTC to hedge delta, while selling calls in the same transaction.  
   - DeFi can unify these steps into a single, atomic flow, potentially improving capital efficiency.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**  
  - A DeFi-based chain replicates advanced features like implied volatility, real-time bid/ask, and a professional UI, but also integrates with a broader ecosystem of lending, staking, and AMMs.  
  - Settlement, margin, and collateral would all be on-chain, offering transparency and composability.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Develop an on-chain options protocol on Flow EVM with robust margin management, enabling advanced strategies like covered calls on staked assets.  
  - Include a user-friendly interface that displays live implied vol, open interest, and other metrics directly from on-chain data or oracles.

![Screenshot 5 – Deribit Option Order Form](DeFi-Platforms-Comparison/Deribit-Place-Options-Order.png)

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **Option Order Form**  
   - The interface shows a **Call** option for 26 Dec 2025 with a strike at 90,000 BTC.  
   - Users can specify the order type (Limit / USD / IV) and quantity in BTC.  
   - Real-time stats: Mark price, future mark, 24h volume, and various Greeks (Lambda, etc.) are visible on the right.

2. **Margin & Position Info**  
   - “Buy Margin” and “Sell Margin” indicate how much BTC is needed as collateral for each side of the trade.  
   - “Position MM impact” can be calculated to see how margin changes once the user takes a position.

3. **Greeks Panel & Bid/Ask Spread**  
   - Shows individual quotes for different quantities, with columns for IV, bid/ask, and implied USD price.  
   - The Greeks (Delta, IV, etc.) help users gauge option pricing and risk.

4. **Customizable Execution Types**  
   - Toggle between “Limit,” “Advanced” (like USD or IV-based entry), or “GTC” (Good ‘Til Canceled).  
   - Can reduce position size, post-only, or adjust order validity directly from this module.

---

### What It Has

- **Comprehensive Option Parameters**: Users can price their trades in terms of BTC, USD, or implied volatility.  
- **Margin Calculation**: Built-in margin estimation for both buy and sell side.  
- **Detailed Contract Specs**: Mark Price, Index, and contract expiry info all in one place.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **On-Chain Collateral Diversity**  
   - Still BTC-based margin. In DeFi, staked or tokenized collateral can be used for options.  
   - No direct synergy with yield tokens or cross-protocol positions.

2. **Atomic Multi-Leg Orders**  
   - Traders must open individual positions manually. DeFi could allow bundling multiple option legs plus collateral deposit in one transaction.

3. **Automation / Smart Vaults**  
   - In DeFi, vault strategies might automatically roll expiring options or adjust strike prices based on user preferences.

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **IV-Based Order Placement in DeFi**  
   - A Flow-based options protocol could let users specify an implied volatility target rather than just a price.  
   - Could be useful in lower-liquidity environments to systematically trade based on implied volatility preferences.

2. **Composability with Borrowing & Hedging**  
   - In one Cadence-driven flow, a user might borrow stablecoins, buy a call option, and hedge with a short on another protocol, all in one step.

3. **Automated Rolling**  
   - Smart contracts could automatically roll options on expiry if conditions are met (e.g., user sets a threshold IV, or a target strike).  
   - Saves users from manual overhead and mitigates risk of forgetting to roll.

4. **Collateral Token Selection**  
   - At the order form level, let users pick from a list of whitelisted or yield-bearing collateral tokens.  
   - The UI shows margin calculations for each collateral type, factoring in staked yields or token conversion rates.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**  
  - Similar UI possible on Flow EVM, but margin, settlement, and oracles would be on-chain.  
  - Users can incorporate non-traditional collateral, automated multi-step flows, and yield-bearing strategies.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Design a DeFi options DApp with an equally robust order form and real-time margin/Grek monitoring.  
  - Integrate staked or LP token collateral, letting users earn passive yield while trading options in a single, resource-oriented transaction.

![Screenshot 6 – Deribit Option Contract Details](DeFi-Platforms-Comparison/Deribit-Options-Contract-Details.png)

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **Detailed Contract Specifications**  
   - Provides **Mark Price**, **Price Source** (Deribit BTC Index), **Contract Size** (1 BTC), **Min Order Size**, **Tick Size**, and **Expiration Type** (Quarterly).  
   - Users can see exact settlement currency (BTC), expiry date (26 Dec 2025), and min/max buy prices.

2. **Buy vs. Sell Margin**  
   - Immediately shows how much BTC margin is required to buy or sell the option (`0.0051 BTC` vs. `0.0070 BTC` in this case).  
   - “Position MM impact” links to further margin impact calculations.

3. **Greeks per Contract**  
   - **Delta**, **Gamma**, **Vega**, **Theta**, **Rho** are listed, letting traders evaluate the option’s sensitivity to market movements and time decay.

4. **Convenient Single-Page Execution**  
   - The user can check contract details, margin requirements, and real-time order book quotes all in one panel before deciding to buy or sell.

---

### What It Has

- **Clear Visibility** into option parameters and risk metrics.  
- **Unified Margin & Greeks**: No need to switch screens to calculate margin or check implied volatility.  
- **Contract Terms**: Transparency about tick sizes, min order sizes, and settlement details.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **Trustless Settlement**  
   - Settlement relies on Deribit’s centralized matching engine and reference index.  
   - In DeFi, the settlement would be on-chain and might use multiple oracles to determine final settlement price.

2. **Custom Collateral Management**  
   - A DeFi environment could enable multiple or dynamically rebalanced collaterals (e.g., staked tokens plus stablecoins).  
   - Automated top-ups or partial liquidations if the margin ratio drops below a threshold.

3. **Composability with Other Protocols**  
   - In DeFi, the same margin/collateral could be simultaneously earning yield in a lending protocol, or used in an LP, while backing an option position.

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **On-Chain Oracle Aggregation**  
   - Instead of a single “Deribit BTC Index,” a Flow-based system could reference multiple oracles (Chainlink, Pyth, etc.) to derive a robust settlement price.  
   - Increases trustlessness and reduces single-point-of-failure risk.

2. **Collateral Portfolio**  
   - Users might deposit a basket of assets (e.g., staked ETH, stablecoins, Flow tokens) as collateral, with Cadence automatically adjusting the effective margin requirement based on each asset’s volatility.

3. **Risk Dashboard**  
   - A dedicated “Risk” or “Greeks” dashboard that updates in real time across all user positions, integrated with other Flow EVM protocols to show total portfolio risk.

4. **Advanced Expiration Options**  
   - DeFi could experiment with rolling expiries, user-defined settlement windows, or partial expiries not typically offered in centralized platforms.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**  
  - A DeFi platform can replicate Deribit’s clarity on contract details, but settle positions on-chain using decentralized oracles.  
  - Could unify all user positions (spot, lending, yield tokens, options) in a single margin account for a richer, more efficient user experience.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Implement an on-chain options protocol with similarly granular contract specs.  
  - Offer multi-asset collateral support and dynamic margining, giving DeFi traders more capital flexibility while retaining a professional UI/UX.

  ![Screenshot 8 – Option Wizard Example](DeFi-Platforms-Comparison/Derbit-Options-Wizard-Example.png)

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **Option Wizard Workflow**  
   - The user enters basic parameters:  
     1. **Choose currency** (BTC or ETH)  
     2. **Expected Price** at a future date  
     3. **Date of Price Expectation**  
     4. **Total Investment**  
     5. Click **Calculate Strategy**  
   - The wizard suggests an “optimal strategy” based on the user’s price forecast and capital.

2. **Profit & Loss Chart**  
   - A live graph shows the expected PnL at various index prices.  
   - In Screenshot 8, the chart depicts how profit starts to ramp up past a certain strike (the break-even point for a **long call**).

3. **Strategy Details & Metrics**  
   - **Expected ROI%**  
   - **Expected PNL** (in BTC)  
   - **Expected PNL (USD)**  
   - **Max Loss** and **Total Investment**  
   - Users can “Review Order” or copy a strategy link for quick sharing.

4. **Intuitive UI for Non-Experts**  
   - Simplifies options strategy construction by letting users plug in a price target and date, then automatically generating a recommended trade (in this example, a **Long Call** at 140,000 strike).  
   - The chart is more visual than a standard option chain, likely appealing to traders who prefer a scenario-based approach.

---

### What It Has

- **Scenario-Based Strategy Creation**  
  - Great for users who know a future price target but are unsure which option strikes or strategies to pick.  
- **Real-Time PnL Curves**  
  - Instantly updates potential profit/loss across a range of underlying prices.  
- **Easy Sharing**  
  - “Copy Strategy Link” allows traders to share their setup or “wizard” results.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **Composability with Other Protocols**  
   - A DeFi “wizard” might let you factor in borrowed assets, staked collateral, or yield farm returns when building an option strategy.  
   - Could unify multiple DeFi primitives (lending, AMMs, yield tokens) into a single scenario analysis.

2. **Automation / Vault Strategies**  
   - Users could opt for a strategy vault that auto-rebalances or rolls options at expiry.  
   - Could also chain multiple steps: e.g., borrowing stablecoins, buying calls, and placing leftover liquidity in an AMM for yield.

3. **On-Chain Data Integration**  
   - In DeFi, a wizard might pull real-time on-chain liquidity metrics, aggregator prices, or oracle-based volatility feeds.  
   - Transparent, trustless data instead of a centralized platform feed.

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **Scenario Wizards in Flow DeFi**  
   - Create a similar wizard for Flow EVM that helps users pick the best *on-chain* strategy: e.g., “Long Call + Provide Liquidity with Remaining Funds.”  
   - Provide a single “Execute” button, orchestrated by Cadence to handle all resource movements.

2. **Multi-Protocol Simulations**  
   - Let users simulate potential returns if they also deposit tokens into a lending protocol or an AMM during the option’s lifespan.  
   - Show combined PnL if the option is exercised or if the user keeps yield from staked collateral.

3. **Customizable Risk/Reward**  
   - Offer parameter sliders for users to trade off more premium vs. higher or lower strike, or option combos (spread strategies, butterflies, etc.) in a single step.

4. **Collaborative Strategies**  
   - “Copy Strategy Link” could let other DeFi users quickly replicate a combined strategy (option + yield farming), just by clicking a link in a front-end connected to Flow EVM.

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**  
  - A DeFi platform can replicate the scenario-based approach while enabling complex multi-leg, multi-protocol strategies.  
  - Could also leverage lower block times on Flow for near-instant feedback on margin usage, yield rates, or option Greeks.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Develop a “Flow Strategy Wizard” that merges derivative positions, lending, and AMM liquidity under one scenario chart.  
  - Expand the synergy by letting users “batch transact” all steps through Cadence, ensuring atomic execution with minimal friction.

   ![Screenshot 12 – Straddle Setup](DeFi-Platforms-Comparison/Deribit-Straddle-Order.png)

---

### Observations / Commentary

1. **Strategy Templates**  
   - The drop-down includes pre-labeled combos like **Future Spread**, **Vertical Spread**, **Risk Reversal**, **Call Ratio Spread** (1x2), **Condor**, **Straddle**, etc.  
   - Gives traders a quick way to assemble complex multi-leg option positions without manually specifying each leg from scratch.

2. **Combos List**  
   - Shows multiple “Call spread” or “Put spread” trades, each with specific legs (e.g., +1 BTC-11MAR25-90000-C / -1 BTC-11MAR25-92000-C).  
   - Bid/Ask columns provide implied prices, so users can gauge the net cost or credit for each multi-leg strategy.

3. **Create Combo (BTC)**  
   - Traders can pick a strategy template, choose the expiry, strike(s), and call/put arrangement.  
   - Fields for “Amount,” “Bid (Implied),” “Mark,” “Ask (Implied)” let users see the potential fill prices for the entire strategy at once.

4. **Straddle / Strangle**  
   - Buying both a call and put at the same strike/expiry in one interface.  
   - The platform notes it’s a “volatility trade” – bullish on movement up or down past the combined premium.

5. **Advanced Features**  
   - Combining multiple options (or futures + options) in a single ticket.  
   - Includes net Delta, Vega, Theta, Rho calculations for the entire strategy, helping traders assess overall risk.

---

### What It Has

- **Pre-Set Strategy Menus**: Risk reversals, condors, straddles, ratio spreads—makes it easy for users to structure multi-leg trades.  
- **Single Order**: Consolidates multiple legs into one transaction, simplifying execution.  
- **Real-Time Pricing & Greeks**: Shows net Greeks across all legs, plus implied bid/ask for the entire strategy.

---

### What Might Be Missing (Compared to a DeFi Perspective)

1. **Cross-Protocol Composability**  
   - DeFi could integrate multiple protocols in one strategy (e.g., lend stablecoins, use the interest to offset the premium for an options spread).  
   - Additional steps like an AMM liquidity position or yield aggregator could be appended to the same “combo” if the platform is resource-oriented (Cadence).

2. **Collateralization with Yield Tokens**  
   - Instead of simple BTC or stablecoin margin, DeFi might let you stake tokens or hold LP tokens as collateral for these combos, accruing yield while your position remains open.

3. **Atomic Execution Across Different Contract Types**  
   - With Cadence, you could combine an options combo, a perpetual hedge, and a lending action in a single atomic transaction, which Deribit cannot offer as a centralized platform.

---

### Ideas / Suggestions (Drawing From This UI)

1. **Multi-Protocol “Combo Builder” in DeFi**  
   - A “Create Combo” panel that goes beyond option legs—allow the user to add a step for borrowing, a step for providing liquidity in an AMM, and final steps for multi-leg options, all orchestrated via Cadence.

2. **Template Library for “Exotic” Strategies**  
   - In addition to risk reversals and condors, a DeFi UI could integrate power perpetuals, perpetual options, or yield tokens into the combos.  
   - Each template might specify recommended collateral type and yield source.

3. **Net Borrowing or Leverage**  
   - An advanced combo could automatically borrow stablecoins to fund an option spread, so the user’s net capital outlay is minimized.  
   - The system manages margin and liquidation triggers across the entire combo.

4. **Shared Oracle & Risk Engine**  
   - A centralized risk engine inside Cadence-based protocols could unify margin checks for all legs and additional DeFi positions.  
   - Offers real-time net risk across the user’s entire portfolio (options, AMMs, lending).

---

### Comparisons / Where It Could Go

- **Compared to Deribit**  
  - A DeFi-based “Combo” system can replicate the convenience of multi-leg strategies but broaden the scope to nontraditional collateral, yield integration, and cross-protocol synergy.  
  - Execution is trustless and on-chain, giving users full transparency and ownership.

- **Potential Next Steps**  
  - Build a “Flow Strategy Combos” module that seamlessly bundles multiple legs from a Flow EVM options protocol plus interactions with lending or AMM platforms.  
  - Provide advanced risk management with on-chain oracles, automated partial liquidations, and yield accrual for collateral.
